                Hi there! My name is Uwimana Alice, and I'm a passionate frontend developer with a love for creating beautiful and user-friendly web interfaces. With several years of experience in the field, I'm dedicated to delivering high-quality code and exceptional user experiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                I graduated with a degree in Computer Science and have worked on a variety of projects, ranging from small business websites to large-scale web applications. I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm proficient in popular frameworks like React and Bootstrap. I'm also experienced in working with version control systems such as Git.
              </p>
              <p>
                My work philosophy revolves around clean and maintainable code. I believe in writing code that is not only functional but also scalable and optimized for performance. I enjoy collaborating with designers and back-end developers to bring ideas to life, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies and best practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my portfolio, you'll find a collection of projects that I have completed. These projects showcase my ability to create responsive layouts, implement smooth animations, and integrate third-party APIs. Feel free to explore them and get a sense of my coding style and attention to detail.
